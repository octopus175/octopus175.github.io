# About me

My name is Matthew Law and I am a cybersecurity enthusiast who is interested in blue team operation. 
In my OSCP journey, I spend lots of time on CTF platforms like Hack The Box, Try Hack Me and Proving Ground to practice my penetration testing skills, and since then it has become my hobby and I am still active on HTB from time to time. 
Currently, I am working on building my home lab to learn how to set up SIEM, IDS, firewall and other components to practice my red and blue team skills. Also, I am using letsdefend.io to work on the essential skills for a SOC analyst position.


# About this blog

Here you will most likely find write-ups from Hack The Box, Documentation of Home Lab project, OSCP notes/ tips and tricks and study notes for blue team learning.I might also upload other interesting articles that are infosec-related. If you have any questions or want to work with we in the future, you are always welcome to contact me via email or discord.
